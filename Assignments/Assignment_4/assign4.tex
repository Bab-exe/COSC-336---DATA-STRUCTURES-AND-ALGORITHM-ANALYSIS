\lecture{COSC  336 		Assignment 4}{}{}

\textbf{Instructions.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Due date and time: As indicated on Blackboard. 
\item This is a team assignment. Work in teams of 3-4 students.  Submit on Blackboard one assignment per team, with the names of all students making the team. 
\item The exercises will not be graded, but you still need to present your best attempt to solve them. If you do not know how to solve an exercise, say it.  This will give me feedback about your understanding of the theoretical concepts.
\item Your programs must be written in Java.

\item Write your programs neatly - imagine yourself grading your program and see if it is easy to read and understand. 

Comment your programs reasonably: there is no need to comment lines like "i++" but do include brief comments describing the main purpose of a specific block of lines.
\item  You will submit on \textbf{Blackboard} 32 files.  

The \textbf{1-st file} is a pdf file (produced ideally with latex and Overleaf) and it will contain the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The solution to the Exercises (see the remark above).
\item   A short description of your algorithm for the Programming Task, where you explain the dynamic programing approach. Focus on how you have modified MERGE.
\item   A table with the results your program gives  for the data sets indicated for the programming task. 
\item   The java code (so that the grader can make observations) of the  program.
\end{enumerate}


The \textbf{2-nd file} is the .java file containing the java source code for Programming Task.

\item This is a team assignment. Work in teams as in the previous assignments.  Submit one assignment per team, with the names of all students making the team.
\item Your programs must be written in Java.
\item Write your programs neatly - imagine yourself grading your program and see if it is easy to read and understand. 
At the very beginning present your algorithm in plain English or in pseudo-code (or both).
Comment your programs reasonably: there is no need to comment lines like "i++" but do include brief comments describing the main purpose of a specific block of lines.

\item  You will submit on \textbf{Blackboard} two files.  

The \textbf{first file} is a pdf file (produced ideally with latex and Overleaf) and it will contain the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The solutions to the questions in Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4.
\item   A short description of your algorithm for the programming task. Focus on the changes you made compared to the solution given on the indicated web site.
\item   A table with the results your program gives  for the 2 data sets given in input-4.3.txt and input-4.4.txt. 
\item   The java code (so that the grader can make observations).
\end{enumerate}


The \textbf{second file} is the .java file containing the java source code, so that the grader can run your program. 

For editing the pdf file, I recommend that you use Latex, see the template files  posted on Blackboard:
 
           assignment-template.tex 	and  assignment-template.pdf

\textbf{Exercise 1.}
For each of the following functions, give a $\Theta(t(n))$ estimation with the simplest possible $t(n)$ (for example $3n^2 +5 n \log n = \Theta(n^2)$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item $13n^2 - 2n + 56$
\item $2.5 \log n + 2$
\item $n (12 + \log n)$
\item $1+2 + 3 + \ldots + 2n$
\item $1+2 + 3 + \ldots + n^2$
\item $\log (n^3) + 10$
\item $\log(n^3) + n \log n$
\item $n \log(n^3) + n \log n$
\item $2^{2 \log n} + 5n +1$
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip

\textbf{Exercise 2.}  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate the following postfix arithmetic expression:  $10~3~4~-~5~*~/$
\item Convert the following infix arithmetic expression to postfix notation: $(((2+3)*5)-15)$

\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Exercise 3.}

Consider the following algorithms $A$ and $B$ for the problem of computing $2^n \pmod{ 317}$ (This is the modular exponentiation problem that we  have discussed in class. Algorithm $A$ is the one that we have seen in class, and algorithm $B$ is a variant of it.

\begin{verbatim}
Algorithm A.

mod_exp_A(n) {
   if (n== 0) return 1;
   else {
          t = mod_exp_A(n/2);  
          if (n is even) return t*t (mod 317);
          if (n is odd) return t*t*2 (mod 317);
}}
\end{verbatim}


\begin{verbatim}
Algorithm B.

mod_exp_B(n) {
   if (n== 0) return 1;
   else {
          if (n is even) return   mod_exp_B(n/2) * mod_exp_B(n/2) (mod 317);
          if (n is odd) return  mod_exp_B(n/2) * mod_exp_B(n/2) *2 (mod 317);
}}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the recurrence for the runtime $T_A(n)$ of algorithm A, and solve the recurrence to find a $\Theta( \cdot)$ estimation of $T_A(n)$.
\item Write the recurrence for the runtime $T_B(n)$ of algorithm B, and solve the recurrence to find a $\Theta( \cdot)$ estimation of $T_B(n)$.
\item Which algorithm is faster? (Note: There is a huge difference between $T_A$ and $T_B$.)
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip

\textbf{Exercise 4.}
Give a  $\Theta( \cdot)$ evaluation for the runtime of the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
 i= 1; x=0;
 while(i <= n) {
       j=1;
       while (j <= i) { x=x+1; j= 2*j; }
       i= 2*i;
}    


\end{verbatim}
Hint:  You can assume that $n$ is a power two.  Then $i$ from the outer loop takes successivley the values: $1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^{\log n}$. )
\newpage

\textbf{Programming task 1.}

Your program needs to solve the  \emph{Rod Cutting} problem, described in the textbook in Section 14.1, page 364.  In this problem, a rod needs to be cut into segments that yield the maximum revenue, given a list or prices for each segment length. See the description of the problem for details.  You need to implement the algorithm that in addition to computing the maximum revenue, also produces a list of piece sizes that produce the  max revenue. This algorithm is presented in pseudocode in the textbook on page 372 (\textsf{Extended-Bottom-Up-Cut-Rod (p,n)} and \textsf{Print-Cut-Rod-Solution (p,n)}. Thus your program needs to return the maximum revenue, and a list of cuts yielding this revenue (this is the list printed by \textsf{Print-Cut-Rod-Solution (p,n)}.

Test your program on the following data sets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data set 1: 1,5,8,9,10,17,17,20,24,30. (This is the example on page 364).
\item Data set 2: file input-4-2 on Blackboard. The first line is the value of $n$ (the length of the rod), and the second line is the list $p$ of $n$ prices for segments of lengths 1,2, $\ldots, n$.
\item Data set 3: file input-4-3 on Blackboard. As above, the first line is the value of $n$ (the length of the rod), and the second line is the list $p$  of $n$ prices for segments of lengths 1,2, $\ldots, n$.
\end{enumerate}

\if01
Given is a polygon with $n$ vertices  $(x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2), \ldots,(x_n, y_n)$  consisting of adjacent vertical towers as in the picture below.
More precisely, $n$ is even and the line segments alternate between vertical and horizontal (that
is, $x_{2i - 1} = x_{2i}$
for every $i \in \{1, \ldots, n/2\}$, and $y_{2i} = y_{2i+1}$ for every $i \in \{1, \ldots, n/2 - 1\}$.
Additionally, $y_1 = y_n = 0$, every other $y$-coordinate is positive ($y_i > 0$ for every $y \in
\{2, \ldots, n - 1\}$), and the $x$-coordinates form a non-decreasing sequence (that is, $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq
x_3 \leq \ldots  \leq x_n$). Design an $O(n)$ algorithm that finds the largest possible area of an axis parallel
rectangle that fits inside this polygon.   

For example, the input on the left is given by vertices (3, 0),(3, 1),(4, 1),(4, 3),(6, 3),(6, 6),
(10, 6),(10, 2),(13, 2),(13, 5),(17, 5),(17, 1),(18, 1),(18, 8),(20, 8),(20, 0). The rectangle with
the largest area that fits inside this polygon is shown on the right, its area is 26.

This task can be done using a stack. See the main idea applied to a simplified version of the problem at

\url{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-rectangle-under-histogram}

You can use the same idea, but you need to make some adjustments because now the towers do not necessarily have width $1$. Note that it does not work to break a tower into sub-towers of width $1$, because a tower may have a large width, and in this case you obtain a large number of sub-towers which prevents the $O(n)$ solution. In your description (in the pdf file) explain the adjustments you made.



Input specification: the first line contains an even positive integer $n$, indicating the number of vertices of the polygon. Then $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains two integers, $x_i$ and $y_i$, separated by space. You may assume that all numbers fit within int and that $n$  is at most 1,000,000. 

Output specification: the output is a single line with the maximum area of an axis-parallel rectangle that fits inside the polygon.
